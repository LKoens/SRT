# Slender-ribbon Theory
Matlab program for slender ribbon theory developed in https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.2.084101
It solves the slender-ribbon theory intergral equations using a spectral approach with Legendre polynomials in both directions. 
Integrals are evaluated using the build in MATLAB quadradure process.
The system uses parallel processing to evaluate integrals.
